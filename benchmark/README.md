# The BioChatter Benchmark Module

Here we collect procedures and data for the living BioChatter benchmark. The
benchmark follows a standard Pytest procedure (configured in `conftest.py`). We
create a matrix of test cases, tested models, and parameters, and run the tests
periodically. For more information, see the corresponding pages in the
BioChatter docs:
